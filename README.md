## Image Compression using PCA

### Overview
This project demonstrates the use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for compressing images. PCA is a popular dimensionality reduction technique that can be effectively applied to image data to reduce its size while retaining essential information. 

### Key Takeaways
1. **PCA for Image Compression:** PCA is employed to decompose the image into its principal components, effectively reducing its dimensionality.
2. **Channel-wise Compression:** The image is split into its RGB channels, and PCA is applied separately to each channel for better compression.
3. **Reconstruction:** After compressing each channel, the compressed components are used to reconstruct the image.
4. **Visualization:** The original and compressed images are displayed side by side to visually assess the effectiveness of compression.

### Benefits
- **Reduced Storage Space:** PCA compression significantly reduces the storage space required for images while maintaining visual quality.
- **Fast Processing:** PCA-based compression is computationally efficient, making it suitable for real-time applications.
- **Retained Information:** Despite the reduction in size, PCA compression retains the essential features of the image, making it suitable for various applications.

### Usage
- Clone the repository and install the required dependencies.
- Replace the image path in the code with the path to the image you want to compress.
- Run the code to see the original and compressed images side by side.

### Conclusion
Image compression using PCA offers a practical solution for reducing the size of images while preserving essential features. By leveraging the power of PCA, this project provides insights into effective image compression techniques and opens avenues for further exploration in the field of image processing and computer vision.
